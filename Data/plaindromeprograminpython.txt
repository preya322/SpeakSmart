Hello Vedansh, it's nice to meet you! I'm here to help you with any questions or issues you have.

Regarding your request for a palindrome program in Python, here's a simple way to check if a given word or phrase is a palindrome:
```python
def is_palindrome(word):
    return word == word[::-1]

# Test the function
word = "racecar"
if is_palindrome(word):
    print(f"{word} is a palindrome")
else:
    print(f"{word} is not a palindrome")
```
In this program, the `is_palindrome` function takes a string `word` as input and returns `True` if the word is the same forwards and backwards (i.e., a palindrome), and `False` otherwise. The slicing notation `[::-1]` is used to reverse the string.

You can modify this program to suit your needs, such as by adding user input or checking for palindromic phrases. Let me know if you have any questions!
