Hello Vedansh, it's nice to meet you! I'm glad to hear that you are a content writer and create various types of content. I can certainly help you with creating a program for palindrome numbers.

A palindrome number is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed. For example, 121, 1331, and 1551 are all palindrome numbers.

Here is a simple program in Python that checks if a given number is a palindrome:
```python
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
original_num = num

# Reverse the number
reversed_num = 0
while num > 0:
    reversed_num = reversed_num * 10 + (num % 10)
    num = num // 10

# Check if the original number and reversed number are the same
if original_num == reversed_num:
    print(original_num, "is a palindrome number.")
else:
    print(original_num, "is not a palindrome number.")
```
In this program, the user is asked to enter a number. The number is then reversed by extracting its digits one by one and adding them to a new number. Finally, the original number and the reversed number are compared to check if they are the same. If they are, then the number is a palindrome. Otherwise, it's not.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.
